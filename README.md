# Word-Search
This program searches through a word search grid ("grid.txt") and uses the given dictionary ("words.txt") to find words of length at least 6 that appear either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (forward or backward). The result is then outputted in "puzzle.txt" with the words found and their start/end coordinates that the words can be found on the grid.
